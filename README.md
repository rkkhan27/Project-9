## The Moving to Opportunity Experiment & Hypothesis Testing
Millions of low-income Americans live in high-poverty neighborhoods, which also tend to be racially segregated
and sometimes have issues with community violence. While social scientists have long believed a
lack of investment in these neighborhoods contributes to negative outcomes for the residents living in them,
it is often difficult to establish a causal link between neighborhood conditions and individual outcomes.
The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration was designed to test whether offering housing vouchers
(that cover some or all of rental costs) to families living in public housing in high-poverty neighborhoods
could lead to better experiences and outcomes by providing financial assistance to move to higher income
neighborhoods.

Between 1994 and 1998 the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development enrolled 4,604 low-income
households from public housing projects (governement owned housing, usually large apartment blocks) in
Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York in MTO, randomly assigning enrolled families in
each site to one of three groups: (1) The low-poverty voucher group received special MTO vouchers, which
could only be used to cover rent for apartments/homes in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10%
and counseling to assist with relocation; (2) the traditional voucher group received regular section 8 vouchers,
which they could use to cover rent for apartments/houses anywhere; and (3) the control group, who received
no vouchers but continued to qualify for any project-based (government-owned) housing assistance they
were entitled to receive. Today we will use the MTO data to learn if being given the opportunity to move
to lower-poverty neighborhoods improved participants’ economic wellbeing.
